### Hi there, I'm Robin! 👋

I’m a creative developer and love to surround myself with talented individuals and team members.\
Within a few years time, I’ve had the pleasure of working with startups and scale-ups (Solease, MyParcel) running in-house dev teams and established corporations such as MultiSafepay. \

Working on both ends of the software spectrum, doing technical implementation as well as client support, has given me a solid understanding of code and communication.

- 🔭 I’m currently working at MultiSafepay under [@robin-multisafepay](https://github.com/robin-multisafepay)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to focus on one thing at a time! 😛
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, just shoot me a message.
- 💬 Ask me about payments and/or e-commerce development!
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Twitter or send me an email.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been playing guitar for quite a while and love metal! 🎸
