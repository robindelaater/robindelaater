### Hi there, I'm Robin! 👋

I’m a creative developer and love to surround myself with talented individuals and team members.\
Within a few years time, I’ve had the pleasure of working with startups and scale-ups (Solease, MyParcel) running in-house dev teams and established corporations such as MultiSafepay.

Working on both ends of the software spectrum, doing technical implementation as well as client support, has given me a solid understanding of code and communication.

- 💬 Always on to discuss new (development or other) trends in the ecommerce space.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just shoot me an email!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been playing guitar for quite a while and love metal! 🎸
