### Hi there, I'm Robin! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a creative developer and love to surround myself with talented individuals and team members.\
Within a few years time, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with startups and scale-ups (Solease, MyParcel) running in-house dev teams and established corporations such as MultiSafepay.

Working on both ends of the software spectrum, doing technical implementation as well as client support, has given me a solid understanding of code and communication.

- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on anything really, just shoot me a message!
- ðŸ’¬ Always on to discuss new (development or other) trends in the ecommerce space.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on Twitter/X or shoot me an email.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been playing guitar for quite a while and love metal! ðŸŽ¸
